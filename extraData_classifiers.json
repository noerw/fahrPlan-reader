Unfortunately, SafetyNet Attestation is not well documented by Google. This talk is split into three parts. Part one provides a deep dive into SafetyNet Attestation how it works. Part two is a guide on how to implement and use it for real world applications. This is based on the lessons learned from implementing SafetyNet Attestation for an app with a large install base. The talk will provide you with everything you need to know about Android’s SafetyNet Attestation and will help you to implement and use it in your app. Part three presents attacks and bypasses against SafetyNet Attestation. The attack method targets not only SafetyNet but other similar approaches.

This situation raised our awareness on the lack of research in our community about operating and detecting spying microphones. Our biggest concern was that most of the knowledge came from fictional movies. Therefore, we performed a deep study on the state-of-the-art of microphone bugs, their characteristics, features and pitfalls. It included real life experiments trying to bug ourselves and trying to detect the hidden mics. Given the lack of open detection tools, we developed a free software SDR-based program, called Salamandra, to detect and locate hidden microphones in a room. After more than 120 experiments we concluded that placing mics correctly and listening is not an easy task, but it has a huge payoff when it works. Also, most mics can be detected easily with the correct tools (with some exceptions on GSM mics). In our experiments the average time to locate the mics in a room was 15 minutes. Locating mics is the novel feature of Salamandra, which is released to the public with this work. We hope that our study raises awareness on the possibility of being bugged by a powerful actor and the countermeasure tools available for our protection.","language":"en","track_name":"Ethics, Society \u0026 Politics","room_name":"Saal Borg","duration":3600,"speaker_names":"Veronica Valeros, Sebastian Garcia","event_url":"https://frab.cccv.de/en/34c3/events/8735","speakers":[{"public_name":"Veronica Valeros","abstract":"Veronica Valeros is a hacker, researcher and intelligence analyst from Argentina.

Computer vision systems are already deployed in various domains but a detailed discussion of the decision making processes, their effects on society, and policy have not been carried on in the computer science, ethics, or social science communities. State-of-the-art vision systems combine vision models with natural language models to form \"visual-semantic spaces\" that have led to big improvements in tasks such as captioning images and answering visual questions. In a recent paper we showed that semantic word embeddings absorb cultural stereotypes [1]. Here, we study the same question in the context of joint visual-semantic embeddings. Joint embeddings are useful for image retrieval and such systems are likely to reflect existing biases such as a doctor being male and a nurse being female. A more worrying example is a video analytics system that could return results biased toward some racial groups when queried for suspicious activity. Such vision systems present great advances for artificial intelligence but at the same time might perpetuate or even amplify existing biases. The quantitative methods we develop will help detect, understand, and mitigate such biases.\r\n\r\n[1] Caliskan, Aylin, Joanna J.

Her work involves the heavy use of machine learning and natural language processing to characterize and quantify aspects of human behavior. Her research builds upon the key element of feature extraction for rigorous analysis of large-scale corpora and machine learning models. Her recent work on fairness, accountability, and transparency, particularly uncovering bias in language models, has received great attention upon the publication of ``Semantics derived automatically from language corpora contain human-like biases'' at Science. She continues investigating bias in joint visual-semantic models of artificial intelligence to explore their intersections with natural intelligence and society. Her doctoral research on the two main realms, privacy and security, combines machine learning with natural language processing. The applications of this research complement each other by enhancing security and preserving privacy. She demonstrated large-scale de-anonymization of programmers of source code and executable binaries. She also performed authorship attribution on authors of micro-text in social media and l33tsp34k in cyber criminal forums via stylometric analysis.

Using an object of an incompatible base type instead of a derived type results in type confusion.

Interestingly, the susceptibility of electronic devices to electromagnetic interference has been advertised since the 90’s. Regarding the high integration of sensors and digital systems to control power-grids, telecom networks and automation infrastructures (e.g. Smart-grids, Industrial Control Systems), the intrinsic vulnerability of electronic devices to electromagnetic interference is of fundamental interest. In the context of IT Security, few studies have been carried out to understand how the effects may be a significant issue especially in the far-field region (distance between the transmitter’s antenna and the target with regard to the wavelength/central frequency). Most studies in Emanation Security (EMSEC) are related to near-field probing for side-channel and fault injection attacks assuming a close physical access to the targeted devices. In this paper, we propose a methodology to detect, classify and correlate the effect induced during the intentional exposure of analogue and digital systems to electromagnetic interference. Applying this methodology, the implication of the effects for the IT security world will be discussed with regards to the attacker profile needed to set-up a given scenario.

From a physicist's perspective, wireless radiation is just light, to be precise: coherent electromagnetic radiation. It is virtually the same as the beam of a laser, except that its wavelength is much longer (cm vs µm). \r\n\r\nWe have developed a way to visualize this radiation, providing a view of the world as it would look like for eyes sensitive to wireless radiation. \r\n\r\nOur scheme is based on holography, a technique to record three-dimensional pictures by a phase-coherent recording of radiation in a two-dimensional plane. This technique is traditionally implemented using laser light. We have adapted it to work with wireless radiation, and recorded holograms of building interiors illuminated by the omnipresent stray field of wireless devices. In the resulting three-dimensional images we can see both emitters (appearing as bright spots) and absorbing objects (appearing as shadows in the beam). Our scheme does not require any knowledge of the data transmitted and works with arbitrary signals, including encrypted communication. \r\n\r\nThis result has several implications: it could provide a way to track wireless emitters in buildings, it could provide a new way for through-wall imaging of building infrastructure like water and power lines.

The radio signal is AES-128 encrypted and the system is marketed to be “as secure as online banking”. In comparison to conventional and often trivial to break wireless access control systems, the system should thus make it practically infeasible to clone a genuine transmitter so that attackers can get unauthorized access. We used the low-cost CCC rad1o software defined radio (SDR) platform to intercept and analyze the wireless radio signal. We took apart several Hoermann BiSecur hand transmitters and subsequently utilized a vulnerability in the microcontroller to successfully extract the firmware. In order to conduct a security audit, the extracted firmware was disassembled and analyzed so that the encryption mechanism, the key material, the cryptographic operations as well as the RF interface could be reverse engineered. Our security analysis shows that the overall security design is sound, but the manufacturer failed to properly initialize the random seed of the transmitters. As a result, an attacker can intercept an arbitrary radio frame and trivially compute the utilized encryption key within less than a second. Once the key is known to the attacker, a genuine transmitter can be cloned with an SDR platform such as the CCC rad1o. In addition to unauthorized operation of gates and doors, there is a likely (although currently untested) impact on Smart Home appliances that use the BiSecur system. We tested a total of 7 hand transmitters from 3 different model series and with manufacturing dates between 2015 and 2017. All analyzed hand transmitters shared the same static random seed and were found to be vulnerable to our attack. The vulnerability can easily be fixed so that future hand transmitters and radio transmission are protected from our attack.","language":"en","track_name":"Security","room_name":"Saal Clarke","duration":3600,"speaker_names":"Markus Müllner, Markus Kammerstetter","event_url":"https://frab.cccv.de/en/34c3/events/9029","speakers":[{"public_name":"Markus Müllner, Markus Kammerstetter","abstract":"","description":"","availabilities":[{"start_date":"2017-12-27T15:00:00.000+01:00","end_date":"2017-12-28T03:00:00.000+01:00","day_id":362},{"start_date":"2017-12-28T10:00:00.000+01:00","end_date":"2017-12-29T03:00:00.000+01:00","day_id":363},{"start_date":"2017-12-29T10:00:00.000+01:00","end_date":"2017-12-30T03:00:00.000+01:00","day_id":364},{"start_date":"2017-12-30T10:00:00.000+01:00","end_date":"2017-12-30T12:00:00.000+01:00","day_id":365}]}],"event_classifiers":{"Security":100,"Hardware":100}},{"event_id":9030,"track_id":333,"room_id":416,"start_time":"2017-12-27T15:30:00.000+01:00","title":"Algorithmic science evaluation and power structure: the discourse on strategic citation and 'citation cartels'","abstract":"Quantitative science evaluation, such as university rankings, rely on man-made algorithms and man-made databases.

I already presented at the 33c3 about the the information that can be gathered from DNA samples e.g. in private companies.","description":"","availabilities":[{"start_date":"2017-12-27T17:00:00.000+01:00","end_date":"2017-12-28T03:00:00.000+01:00","day_id":362},{"start_date":"2017-12-28T10:00:00.000+01:00","end_date":"2017-12-29T03:00:00.000+01:00","day_id":363},{"start_date":"2017-12-29T10:00:00.000+01:00","end_date":"2017-12-30T03:00:00.000+01:00","day_id":364},{"start_date":"2017-12-30T10:00:00.000+01:00","end_date":"2017-12-30T18:00:00.000+01:00","day_id":365}]}],"event_classifiers":{"Science":50,"Ethics, Politics + Society ":50,"Resilience":30}},{"event_id":9047,"track_id":328,"room_id":416,"start_time":"2017-12-29T22:30:00.000+01:00","title":"Taxation","abstract":"Taxation, the most \"boring\" #34c3 talk, but hey it's the economy stupid, and you pay for it!

I will discuss the current state of immigration enforcement in the US and associated surveillance capabilities, the results of a study with undocumented immigrants about their technology practices, and the takeaways for the technology and privacy community in supporting communities of heightened risk.","language":"en","track_name":"Ethics, Society \u0026 Politics","room_name":"Saal Clarke","duration":3600,"speaker_names":"Allison McDonald","event_url":"https://frab.cccv.de/en/34c3/events/9085","speakers":[{"public_name":"Allison McDonald","abstract":"I am a PhD student at the University of Michigan working with J.

The Anthropocene qualitatively differs from previous eras in Earth’s history in three key characteristics: (1) There is planetary-scale human agency. (2) There are social and economic networks of teleconnections spanning the globe. (3) It is dominated by planetary-scale social-ecological feedbacks. Bolting together old concepts and methodologies cannot be an adequate approach to describing this new geological era. Instead, we need a new paradigm in Earth System science that is founded equally on a deep understanding of the physical and biological Earth System – and of the economic, technological, social and cultural forces that are now an intrinsic part of it.

We will see why these two layers are a lie: there are way more layers involved on a modern NIC.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the talk looks at the evolution from 10 Mbit/s to 100 Gbit/s networks - both from a hardware perspective and how the software had to change from Linux pre-NAPI all the way to Linux XDP to keep up.\r\nWe will follow a packet through a typical NIC, driver, and operating system and see a lot of pitfalls while the packet traverses a software stack involving hundreds of thousands of lines of code in the driver and operating system.\r\nReading and understanding so much code is quite tedious, so the obvious next question is: How hard can it be to implement a driver for a modern 10 Gbit/s NIC from scratch while ignoring all of the existing software layers?\r\nTurns out that it's not very hard: I've written \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/emmericp/ixy\"\u003eixy\u003c/a\u003e, a driver for 10 Gbit/s NICs from the Intel 82599 family (X520, X540, X550) from scratch in just about 1000 lines of C code.\r\nixy is a full userspace driver: you get your raw packets delivered directly into your application and the operating system doesn't even know the NIC exists.\r\nUserspace drivers are also very hackable, you get direct access to the full hardware in your application in userspace making it really easy to test out new features, no pesky kernel code needed.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the talk focuses on my custom driver and the Intel 82599 architecture as it is easy to understand, has a great datasheet, and the core functionality is in the driver as opposed to a magic black-box firmware.\r\nYou will not only learn about my driver implementation - the talk also discusses how it relates to similar network frameworks like DPDK or Snabb and seemingly similar frameworks like netmap, XDP, pf_ring, or pfq.\r\n\r\n","language":"en","track_name":"Hardware \u0026 Making","room_name":"Saal Borg","duration":1800,"speaker_names":"Paul Emmerich","event_url":"https://frab.cccv.de/en/34c3/events/9159","speakers":[{"public_name":"Paul Emmerich","abstract":"Paul is a PhD student at Technical University of Munich where he does various stuff with networks.\r\nHe mostly works his packet generator \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/emmericp/MoonGen\"\u003eMoonGen\u003c/a\u003e.","description":"I've been working on my PhD since 2014 where I'm exploring the performance of software and hardware packet processing systems and forwarding devices/applications.\r\n\r\nPure academia was too boring and theoretical for me, so I've always done some consulting for mostly network and storage things beside my research position.
